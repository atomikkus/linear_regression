# Linear Regression

# Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables. In simpler terms, linear regression helps us analyze how changes in one variable are associated with changes in another, allowing us to make predictions and uncover patterns in data.
